## INTRODUCTION:

E-commerce is fast gaining ground as an accepted and used business paradigm. More and more
business houses are implementing web sites providing functionality for performing commercial
transactions over the web. It is reasonable to say that the process of shopping on the web is
becoming commonplace.

The objective of this project is to develop a general purpose e-commerce store where product
like clothes can be bought from the comfort of home through the Internet. However, for
implementation purposes, this paper will deal with an online shopping for clothes.

An online store is a virtual store on the Internet where customers can browse the catalog and
select products of interest. The selected items may be collected in a shopping cart. At checkout
time, the items in the shopping cart will be presented as an order. At that time, more
information will be needed to complete the transaction. Usually, the customer will be asked to
fill or select a billing address, a shipping address, a shipping option, and payment information
such as credit card number. An e-mail notification is sent to the customer as soon as the order
is placed.
